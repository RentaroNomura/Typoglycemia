# Typoglycemia
Typoglycemia written in Python.
I tested this code only on macOS, if there are any issuses feel free to leave message in the isuues section of this repository.

# Library requirement
- Python 3
- tkinter
- pykakasi(available on pip)
- random
- unicodedata

# How to use
This program converts the text whitch you type in the text filed into Typoglycemia.
I deployed two mode. English mode(EM) and Japanese mode(JP).

**EN mode:** This mode is default 

**JP mode:** You can select this mode from radioButton placed upper-right corner of the window. In this mode, you can input a space and characters in "Zenkaku" including "Kanji" but if you use "Kanji", It'll be automatically converted to "Hiragana". 

I used *pykakasi* to realize this feature and I'm alredy aware of some errors in convertion.
